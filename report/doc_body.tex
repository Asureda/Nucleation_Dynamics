\newpage
\section{INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND} 

First Light Fusion (FLF) inertial confinement fusion device is based on the nuclear reaction induced by the impact of a high-speed projectile onto a target mainly made of the fusion fuel (D-T). The use of Liquid Lithium (LL) in form of jet array in the Reactor Chamber (RC) plays a key role as tritium breeder, primary carrier of energy throughout the system, heat and nuclear shielding. \\

\noindent Taking into account that the primary carrier of energy is the LL, its circulation through the system is key to achieve the desired power cycle. This involves ensuring optimal circulation within the primary loop to maximize desired outcomes, such as purification of liquid metal from impurities introduced during operation and efficient management of tritium generated by neutron interactions for overall fuel cycle efficiency.\\

\noindent Considering the requirement to achieve an impurities control in the LL loop of the RC system, the current project studies the feasibility to separate the solid impurities from the liquid metal by means of centrifugal technologies. The first deliverable ref. \cite{SoA} explored the different technologies that potentially could address the LL loop purification.\\

\noindent The objective of the present document is to study from chemical point of view the feasibility of separate the solids impurities from the liquid media (LL), by means of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) where fundamental parameters such as critical radius, and its evolution by means of nucleation in the media.

\section{STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT} % ··························································

The present document it is divided in three main blocks, as per the scope section \ref{sec:scope} list. The blocks are divided by disciplines: impurities analysis SoA, chemical assessment, and engineering assessment including the thermo-hydraulic solid separator mathematical model. \\

\noindent Section \ref{sec:impurity} reviews the impurities and corrosion products in the FLF primary loop. The source of impurities are analyzed from chemical perspective in order to establish a baseline for future analysis. At the same time, a subsection is dedicated to review in the literature the corrosion products from the interaction of liquid lithium with the pipelines made SS316-Ti. The last subsection discusses the Maroni method for tritium extraction and addresses its advantages/disadvantages. \\

\noindent Section \ref{sec:chem} is deeply dedicated to the chemical analysis of the impurities, specially focused on six impurities (established by FLF: Fe, Cr, AlN, Li2O, LiQ, Li2C2) studying the Particle Size Distribution and its temporal evolution to establish the critical radius of the impurities. A specific analysis has been carried to explain the solvers and convergence benchmarks for the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's) system develop to understand the different phenomena. Finally, for the non-metallic impurities, a dedicated analysis is the precipitation of those impurities by means of advective-reacting diffusion equation model.  \\

\noindent Section \ref{sec:eng} studies the single and multi-step solid separators with the aim to select the most appropriate centrifugal system for the FLF purification process for the primary loop. Mathematical model has been developed of a solid separator to study different parameter in order to set the possible efficiencies of the device per particle size. Finally, the section describes which device should be studied in the next stage of the current project, from a design and CFD point of view.

\section{IMPURITY AND CORROSION ANALYSIS} \label{sec:impurity}% ··························································
\subsection{Impurities Matrix}

Within the scope of the current document, the identification of the impurities source and its main properties is key to provide the necessary context for the coming sections. Given the FLF machines and components, such as: machine gun (upper launcher), Reactor Chamber (RC), and the liquid lithium primary loop, the identified impurity sources are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Lithium initial impurities}.
	\item \textbf{Corrosion:} mainly given by the primary loop (piping and components) made of SS316-Ti, it is assumed at some point the RC vessel made of P91 will be a secondary source of corrosion impurities. The section \ref{sec:corrosion} is dedicated to identify the corrosion products, mechanisms, and its source.
	\item \textbf{Pulsed shot (projectile + target):} considering the input metallic impurities given by FLF (Fe, Cr, AlN), it is assumed in the current document that part of these impurities will be generated at the pulsed operation due to the projectile impact with the target, example of this is the presence of Cr. Future studies will be necessary to identify and classify the impurities result of the pulsed operation. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lithium initial impurities}

The initial lithium impurities is a key source in terms of traceability, even more  considering that these impurities can mutate within the system under neutronic irradiation. The Figure \ref{Li_init_imp_chart} shows the list of impurities, ranked in the horizontal axis by concentration and vertically the density of element.

The Maroni process has been studied in the SoA deliverable ref. \cite{SoA}, where the process diagram Figure \ref{maroni} of a molten-salt extraction and its stages were analyzed. Nevertheless, the current section is focused in study the advantages/disadvantages of Maroni process, presented in Table \ref{ad_dis_maroni}.

This aspect of the design underscores the importance of ensuring a consistent tritium flow and concentration within the system, which is fundamental to the reactor's operational efficiency and safety.  & \textbf{Solubility:} At the operational temperatures of mixing/separating the lithium and salts, the saturation solubility will be reached in the other.

\section{CHEMICAL ANALYSIS} \label{sec:chem}% ··························································

This section investigates the nucleation of impurities within liquid lithium, which serves as a breeder and shielding material in the reaction chamber. The nucleation of impurities within liquid lithium poses a 
complex challenge, impacting not only the material's thermal and physical properties but also the safety and longevity of the fusion reactors. Despite its significance, 
the study of impurity nucleation in liquid lithium remains underexplored, with limited literature providing a comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms.
\\
Due to the objective of using purification processes based on centrifugation phenomena, the limiting factor of these impurities will be their densities, the quantities in which 
they are present and above all the particle size of these impurities. Therefore, as a starting point for the characterisation of these impurities from a thermodynamic and kinetic point of view, 
classical nucleation theory (CNT) and kinetic theory have been used to study the evolution and speed of this phenomenon.
\\
The primary issue with this model stems from its oversimplifications, which will be detailed in subsequent sections. A significant limitation is that these models originate from statistical mechanics, 
constraining them to a limited number of particles. Specifically, when examining clusters of macroscopic particles on the scale of micrometers, employing statistical mechanics or molecular dynamics models proves 
impractical. Consequently, for such scales, the application of continuous models becomes more appropriate, examples of which include phase field models \cite{Zhu2004,Garcia}, computational fluid dynamics or precipitation dynamics \cite{Sommitsch}.

Furthermore, this research can serve as a foundational basis for applying continuous models more effectively. For instance, one could enhance these models by incorporating the distributions of nanometric particles within the system as input parameters. 
\\
This section is structured for clarity and comprehension, starting with an explanation of classical nucleation theory and the thermodynamics of the nucleation process. This is followed by an analysis 
of the kinetic treatment of the process. 
The section concludes with the characterization of each impurity.

\subsection{Nucleation Theory}
First-order phase transitions, such as the condensation of vapor, boiling of a liquid, and crystallization of a melt, are critical phenomena in materials science and thermodynamics.
The decay of metastable states, such as the solidification of a supercooled liquid, takes place through the nucleation and growth of some small-sized clusters within the system \cite{Larissa}. The 
initial stage of the phase transformation is usually described within the time-honored CNT \cite{Volmer1926,Hayashi1974}, where the droplet is described as a sphere of, say, bulk solid, 
separated from the liquid by a sharp interface, giving rise to a free-energy penalty proportional to the interface area and a total Gibbs-free-energy activation barrier.

\begin{equation}
    \Delta G(i) = -|\Delta\mu|i + A\gamma_{\infty} i^{2/3},
\end{equation}

where \(i\) is the number of particles in the cluster, \(\Delta\mu < 0\) is the chemical potential difference between the two phases, \(A = (36 \pi \nu^2)^{1/3}\) being \(\nu\) 
the molecular volume and \(\gamma_{\infty}\) the specific surface energy (surface tension) of the planar interface, all anisotropies being neglected at this stage. The droplet grows if it exceeds a 
critical size \(i^\ast\) corresponding to the maximum \(\Delta G(i)\) (\(\equiv \Delta G^\ast\)). 
The CNT relies on the liquid droplet model, which assumes that tiny droplets possess the same characteristics as the bulk 
condensed phases and have surface energies identical to those of an infinite flat surface. Nonetheless, there is an ongoing 
debate about the applicability of macroscopic thermodynamic principles to describe liquid drops when dealing with small clusters 
composed of merely a few dozen molecules \cite{Wilemski}. The inadequacy of the droplet model for small particles is highlighted by the fact that the 
energy required to form monomers is not zero \cite{Gránásy}. This indicates that the attributes of small clusters cannot be 
simply categorized into bulk and surface properties, rendering the notion of surface tension somewhat misleading when applied to these clusters \cite{Anisimov}.
For instance, the 'monomers' of the new phase are indistinguishable from the molecules of the parent phase, leading to the conclusion that the free energy of monomers should logically 
be zero (\(\Delta G(1) = 0\)) \cite{Laszlo1}. 
\\
However, in the conceptual state of this work, this simple model is useful to provide quantitatively and qualitatively the critical size of these nuclei.
\\
CNT also is able to estimate the nucleation rate

\begin{equation}
    I = I_0 e^{-\beta \Delta G^\ast},
\end{equation}

where \(\beta = 1/(k_B T)\) is the inverse temperature and \(I_0\) a kinetic prefactor that varies slowly with \(T\). Clearly, this connection between \(I\) and \(\gamma_{\infty}\) relies 
on several severe approximations. Moreover, \(I_0\) is notoriously influenced by genuinely non-equilibrium effects and various expressions resulting from a more detailed consideration of the nucleation kinetics are known since a 
long time \cite{Hayashi1974}.

\paragraph{} In the nucleation regime, the evolution of the system is significantly marked by the formation of clusters that represent a new equilibrium phase. The dynamics of this process 
are intricately governed by the balance between volume and surface contributions, as encapsulated by the capillary approximation. The volume contribution, acting as the driving 
force behind nucleation, lowers the system's free energy and is directly proportional to the cluster's volume, thereby favoring the formation and growth of these clusters. Conversely, 
the surface contribution introduces an energetic cost, scaling with the cluster's surface area. This cost is associated with creating an interface between the original phase and the new 
cluster, serving as a barrier that inherently inhibits the growth of the cluster \cite{Clouet1}.

The critical size of the nucleus and the nucleation barrier are determined by setting the derivative of \(\Delta G\) with respect to the size, \(i\), equal to zero:

\begin{equation}
    R^* = -2\gamma_{\infty} (\Delta \mu / \nu)^{-1},
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
    \Delta G^\ast = \frac{16 \pi}{3} \gamma_{\infty}^3(\Delta \mu / \nu)^{-2}.
\end{equation}

Analyzing the critical parameters obtained from the CNT, is it evident that the key variables of the model are the nucleation driving force and the surface energy. In the following sections,
some formalisms for the driving force will be presented and discussed, as well as for the surface energy. 
\subsubsection{Driving force}
The nucleation driving force is obtained by considering the difference in chemical potentials between the parent and the equilibrium phases for all atoms composing the cluster:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta \mu = \sum_i y_i^e (\mu_i^e - \mu_i^0),
\end{equation}

where \(y_i^e\) is the atomic fraction of type \(i\) atoms in the nucleating equilibrium phase, and \(\mu_i^e\) and \(\mu_i^0\) are the corresponding chemical 
potentials in the nucleating equilibrium phase and in the parent phase, respectively. In a metastable parent phase, chemical potentials are higher than those at equilibrium. 
The critical factors for applying CNT are the driving force, \(\Delta \mu\), and the surface energy, \(\gamma_{\infty}\), of the solid particle. The driving force depends 
on the nucleation pathway, such as the saturation-based formalism commonly used in the context of vapor to liquid or crystal transitions \cite{Myerson2019, Ford2004, Sun2009}:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu = \mu - \mu_{\text{coex}} = kT \ln\left(\frac{n_1}{n_1^{\text{sat}}}\right),
\end{equation}

where the chemical potential is represented using the ideal gas expression, introducing a monomer density \(n_1^{\text{sat}}(T)\) appropriate to a saturated vapor, i.e., a gas phase in coexistence with the condensed phase at the environmental temperature. The ratio of the monomer density in a metastable vapor to its value in a saturated vapor defines the supersaturation, \(S\):

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu = kT \ln S.
\end{equation}

This driving force dictates the nucleation process, which is governed by temperature, the degree of supersaturation, and the interfacial energy. The nucleation rate increases with the degree of supersaturation and temperature and decreases with the interfacial energy. This behavior is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:free_energy_illustrative_degree_saturation}, which shows the energy barrier that must be overcome to form a new phase for various degrees of supersaturation.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{free_energy_illustrative_degree_saturation.png}
    \caption{Required free energy, as per classical nucleation theory, for the formation of a cluster of size \(i\). Curves represent different constant values of supersaturation and temperature, illustrating the free energy barrier associated with the critical size.}
    \label{fig:free_energy_illustrative_degree_saturation}
\end{figure}

This formalism is pertinent for analyzing solutes dissolved in liquids that nucleate in either liquid or crystalline states. However, CNT is not always successful, primarily because the capillarity approximation, upon which it is based, is a very primitive characterization of small molecular clusters. Nevertheless, the expressions derived provide intuitive value, suggesting that increasing the vapor supersaturation, \(S\), accelerates the nucleation of droplets, all other parameters being constant. Additionally, the nucleation rate is influenced by the surface tension of the condensed phase: higher surface tension, \(\gamma_{\infty}\), results in a slower rate. The rate is also quite sensitive to supersaturation, surface tension, and temperature, as these quantities appear inside an exponential function \cite{Ford}.

To surpass the predictive capability of classical theory, it is necessary to compute the partition functions of clusters of various sizes and develop a more realistic model of the excess free energy; however, this is beyond the scope of this work.

Another formalism that may be useful for this study involves the definition of the driving force commonly used in the phase transition between melts and crystalline phases. Consider a single-component liquid initially at equilibrium, quenched to a temperature \(T\), below its melting temperature \(T_m\). Since the liquid and solid phases have the same composition, the nucleation free energy corresponds to the free energy difference between the liquid and solid states at temperature \(T\), in other words, the driving force is a function that depends on the undercooling rate \cite{Clouet1, Fokin2006}:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu = \frac{\Delta H_{m}}{T_{m}}(T_{m} - T) + \int_{T}^{T_{m}} \Delta C_{p} dT' - T \int_{T}^{T_{m}} \frac{\Delta C_{p}}{T'} dT',
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta H_{m}\) and \(T_{m}\) are the molar heat of melting and the melting temperature of the crystal, respectively, and \(\Delta C_{p} = C_{p}^{l} - C_{p}^{c}\) is the difference between the molar heat capacities of liquid and crystal at constant pressure. The experimental values of \(\Delta G_{V}\) are normally bounded by the approximations usually assigned to Turnbull and Hoffman that assume \(\Delta C_{p} = 0\) and \(\Delta C_{p} = \) constant, respectively:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu(T) =  \frac{\Delta H_{m}}{N_A} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_{m}} \right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu(T) = \frac{\Delta H_{m}}{N_A} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_{m}} \right) \frac{T}{T_{m}},
\end{equation}

Here, \(\Delta H_{m}\) is the melting enthalpy per mole of the crystal and \(N_A\) is Avogadro's number. When the undercooling is large, the expression may not be precise enough. One can then consider the next term in the Taylor expansion leading to the Turnbull and Hoffman equations respectively \cite{Clouet1}:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu(T) = \frac{\Delta H_{m}}{N_A} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_{m}} \right)  - \Delta C_{p} \left( \frac{(T - T_{m})^2}{2T_{m}} \right),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\mu(T) =  \frac{\Delta H_{m}}{N_A} \left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_{m}} \right) \frac{T}{T_{m}}   - \Delta C_{p} \left( \frac{(T - T_{m})^2}{2T_{m}} \right).
\end{equation}

This formalism is widely used in the study of the nucleation of impurities in metallic melts, with a wide range of materials, such as metallic glasses like Li\(_2\)O\(_2\)SiO\(_2\) and LS\(_2\), or other metallic alloys like Ge\(_2\)Sb\(_2\)Te\(_5\) and (Ag,In)-doped Sb\(_2\)Te (AIST) \cite{Laszlo1, Neilson1979, Kelton1983, Laszlo3, Laszlo4, Sun2009}.

Using these models to describe the driving force, they exhibit certain limitations. Firstly, within the formalism derived from the degree of saturation, an ideal mixture is assumed. This is evident since concentrations or mole fractions are used to determine the degree of supersaturation rather than activities. To rigorously work through activities, the driving force can be determined if the interaction parameters between the components of the solution are known \cite{Bartels1991}, or determine the mixing parameters starting from the partition function derived from the grand canonical potential, employing the \textbf{quasi-chemical approximation} formulation \cite{Odusote2020} or exponential models \cite{Yadav2023}.

In the second formulation, which utilizes the undercooling rate to determine the driving force, the approach is widely recognized and accepted. However, this formula encounters limitations when applied to mixtures exhibiting degrees of immiscibility. Specifically, the challenge arises in scenarios where two phases coexist, such as in solid-liquid equilibrium. In these instances, given a particular composition for which a certain temperature allows both phases to be in equilibrium; this temperature is referred to as the liquidus temperature \(T_l\).

The standard application of this formulation presents issues as it traditionally employs the absolute melting point to determine the driving force, neglecting the presence of different phases that may manifest within the system.

A potential rectification for this oversight involves the utilization of the \(T_l\) instead of \(T_m\). However, this correction is not without its challenges. Specifically, when the fraction of one of the phases is exceedingly low, accurately determining the liquidus temperature within the phase diagram becomes problematic. This difficulty is compounded by the typical unavailability of high-resolution phase diagrams.


Ideally, the driving force in phase transition studies is determined by a comprehensive thermodynamic model that includes information about the elements present in the system, as demonstrated in previous works \cite{Was1985, Kumar1996}. However, due to the limitations previously stated, an alternative formulation for the driving force has been developed to provide a more accurate description of the volumetric free energy. This method involves calculating the Gibbs free energy change, \(\Delta G\), defined by the free energy expressions for the liquid (\(l\)) and solid (\(s\)) phases.

The chemical potential for component A in the liquid phase, \(\mu_A^l\), is determined by constructing a tangent to the liquid free energy curve at the composition \(x_l\). The point where this tangent line intersects the \(x_A = 1\) axis defines \(\mu_A^l\). Similarly, the chemical potential for component A in the solid phase, \(\mu_A^s\), is identified at the intersection of the tangent line with the \(x_A = 0\) axis.

At the liquidus temperature \(T_l\), the free energy curves for both the liquid and solid phases are tangent to the line constructed from the previous step. The solid composition that is in equilibrium with the liquid composition \(x_l\) at \(T_l\) is given by the tangent point on the Gibbs free energy curve. This equilibrium composition is denoted as \(x_{s,eq}\) and can be identified on the equilibrium phase diagram.

At a temperature \(T\), arbitrarily lower than \(T_l\), the chemical potentials in the solid, \(\mu_A^s\) and \(\mu_B^s\), and for the liquid, \(\mu_A^l\) and \(\mu_B^l\), are determined as before for the liquid phase. The differences in chemical potential, which drive the phase transition, are defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\Delta\mu_A = \mu_A^l - \mu_A^s \label{eq:delta_mu_A}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
\Delta\mu_B = \mu_B^l - \mu_B^s. \label{eq:delta_mu_B}
\end{equation} 

The free energy change, per unit volume, associated with forming a small amount of solid of composition \(x_{s}^\ast\) out of the liquid is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_v = [x_s^\ast \Delta\mu_A + (1 - x_s^\ast) \Delta\mu_B]/V \label{eq:delta_G_v}
\end{equation} 

where \(V\) is the average molar volume of the solid, assumed here to vary linearly between the molar volumes \(V^A\) and \(V^B\) of the pure solid systems:
\begin{equation}
V = x_s^A V^A + (1 - x_s^A) V^B. \label{eq:V}
\end{equation}
The solid composition that is most likely to nucleate, \(x_n\), is assumed to be the one with the largest difference in free energy, \(\Delta G_v\), between the liquid and solid state. This intuitively obvious assumption is used because of its simplicity. Further justification based on a more rigorous calculation is given in Appendix I. It can be seen from that \(\Delta G_n\) is maximized if \(\Delta \mu^A = \Delta \mu^B\), so that the composition \(x_n\) corresponds to the point of tangency on the solid curve of a line parallel to the tangent to the liquid curve at \(x_l\), so that
\begin{equation}
\bar{\Delta G_v} \approx \Delta \mu^A \approx \Delta \mu^B. \label{eq:bar_delta_G_v}
\end{equation}
Therefore, given the composition dependence of the liquid and solid free energies, one can calculate the solid nucleus composition and the free energy of formation for the nucleus as a function of initial liquid composition, \(x_l\), and undercooling \(\Delta T = T_l - T\).

For an actual calculation of \(\Delta G_p\), it is necessary to use solution models. Therefore, regular solution behavior is assumed for the liquid phase so that
\begin{align}
\mu_l^A &= \mu_l^{A,0} + RT \ln(x_l^A) + \alpha_l(x_l^A), \label{eq:mu_l_A} \\
\mu_l^B &= \mu_l^{B,0} + RT \ln(x_l^B) + \alpha_l(x_l^B). \label{eq:mu_l_B}
\end{align}

The solid phase is assumed to be a dilute or ideal solution so that \(\alpha_s^A\) and \(\alpha_s^B\) are independent of composition:

\begin{align}
\mu_s^A &= \mu_s^{A,0} + RT \ln(x_s^A) + \alpha_s^A, \label{eq:mu_s_A} \\
\mu_s^B &= \mu_s^{B,0} + RT \ln(x_s^B) + \alpha_s^B. \label{eq:mu_s_B}
\end{align}

Combining equations \eqref{eq:mu_l_A} and \eqref{eq:mu_s_A} gives

\begin{equation}
\Delta \mu^A = (\mu_l^{A} - \mu_s^{A}) + RT \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A}{x_s^A}\right) + \alpha_l(x_l^A) - \alpha_s^A. \label{eq:delta_mu_A_solution}
\end{equation}

For pure metals, it can be assumed that the difference between the heat capacities of the solid and liquid, \(\Delta C_p\), is small, so that

\begin{equation}
\mu_l^{A,0} - \mu_s^{A,0} \approx \Delta S_f (T_m^A - T), \label{eq:mu_difference_pure_metals}
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta S_f\) and \(T_m^A\) are, respectively, the entropy of fusion and the melting temperature of pure A. Therefore, combining equations \eqref{eq:delta_mu_A_solution} and \eqref{eq:mu_difference_pure_metals} gives

\begin{equation}
\Delta \mu^A = T \left[ R \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A}{x_s^A}\right) - \Delta S_f \right] + \alpha_l'(x_l^A), \label{eq:combined_delta_mu_A}
\end{equation}

where
\begin{equation}
\alpha_l'(x_l^A) = \alpha_l(x_l^A) - \alpha_s^A + \Delta H_f. \label{eq:alpha_prime_A}
\end{equation}

Similarly, for component B
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mu^B = T \left[ R \ln\left(\frac{x_l^B}{x_s^B}\right) - \Delta S_f \right] + \alpha_l'(x_l^B). \label{eq:delta_mu_B_solution}
\end{equation}

Now recall that at \(T = T_l\), \(\Delta \mu^A = 0\) so that
\begin{equation}
\alpha'(x_l^A) = -T_l \left[ R \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A}{x_{s,eq}^A}\right) - \Delta S_f^A \right]. \label{eq:alpha_prime_equilibrium_A}
\end{equation}
For a given \(x_l^A\), \(T_l\), and \(x_{s,eq}^A\) can be found from the equilibrium phase diagram. Combining equations \eqref{eq:combined_delta_mu_A} and \eqref{eq:alpha_prime_equilibrium_A} and rearranging terms gives
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mu^A = (T_l - T) \Delta S_f^A + RT \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A}{x_{s}^A}\right) - RT_l \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A}{x_{s,eq}^A}\right). \label{eq:final_delta_mu_A}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for component B
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mu^B = (T_l - T) \Delta S_f^B + RT \ln\left(\frac{x_l^B}{x_{s}^B}\right) - RT_l \ln\left(\frac{x_l^B}{x_{s,eq}^B}\right). \label{eq:final_delta_mu_B}
\end{equation}
Finally, as discussed previously, at \(T < T_l\), the free energy change on nucleation is
\begin{equation}
V \Delta G_v = \Delta \mu^A = \Delta \mu^B. \label{eq:free_energy_change_nucleation}
\end{equation}
Also, since \(\Delta \mu^A = \Delta \mu^B\), from equations \eqref{eq:final_delta_mu_A} and \eqref{eq:final_delta_mu_B}
\begin{equation}
(T_l - T)(\Delta S_f^A - \Delta S_f^B) + RT \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A(1 - x_{s}^A)}{x_{s,eq}^A(1 - x_l^A)}\right) = RT \ln\left(\frac{x_l^A(1 - x_{s,eq}^A)}{x_{s,eq}^A(1 - x_l^A)}\right). \label{eq:final_energy_balance}
\end{equation}

Therefore, given \(x_l\), \(\Delta S_f^A\), \(\Delta S_f^B\), and the equilibrium phase diagram, one can find \(\Delta G\), and \(x_n\) at an arbitrary temperature \(T\) from equations \eqref{eq:final_delta_mu_A}--\eqref{eq:final_energy_balance}. In the limiting case that the solubility of B in crystalline A is zero, the derivation simplifies considerably. Equation \eqref{eq:mu_l_A} still holds but equation \eqref{eq:mu_s_A} becomes \(\mu_s^A = \mu_{s,0}^A\). Therefore, as before
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mu^A = T(R \ln x_l^A - \Delta S_f^A) + \alpha'(x_l^A) \label{eq:simplified_delta_mu_A}
\end{equation}
and since \(\Delta \mu^A = 0\), at \(T_l\),
\begin{equation}
\alpha'(x_l^A) = -T_l(R \ln x_l^A - \Delta S_f^A) \label{eq:simplified_alpha_prime_A}
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
V \Delta G_v = \Delta \mu^A = (T_l - T)(\Delta S_f^A - R \ln x_l^A). \label{eq:simplified_free_energy_change}
\end{equation}
An analogous equation holds for crystallization of pure B. This simplified result is particularly useful for metal-metalloid glass forming alloys such as Au–Si where the equilibrium 
solid solubility of the metalloid in the crystalline metal is very low.

\subsubsection{Surface energy}

As discussed in the previous section, surface energy is one of the critical parameters in CNT. Firstly, because this theory fails to predict the behaviour of small clusters 
and at the same time assumes a surface energy value for a flat surface. In addition, the dependence of the surface energy on the nucleation rate is probably the most important part of this formalism. 

Because this parameter is an exponential in the calculation of the nucleation rate, it depends very strongly on the value of the surface tension. For example, a change in $\gamma_{\infty}$ of only one order of magnitude
leads to a change in the nucleation rate of about eight orders of magnitude \cite{Ulbricht1998}.
\\
Nonetheless, a dependable method for measuring surface tension is absent, with the exception of aligning experimental nucleation rate data with theoretical models \cite{Fokin2006HomogeneousCN}. 
Furthermore, a critical hypothesis of the CNT, referred to as the capillarity approximation, overlooks the influence of curvature and size on surface tension \cite{SANGWAL19963}.
Therefore, ideally it has to be obtained from experiments or from ab-initio calculations \cite{Sun2020, Lee2018, Vitos1998, Holec2012, Binnie2010}. 
Another well-accepted methodology is from the complete thermodynamic model of the mixture, using Buttler's formulation \cite{Silva, Picha2004, Krasin2015}, 
the problem with this methodology arises in having all the information and having a detailed phase diagram.
\\
Given the difficulties noted above in measuring or simulating the surface free energy of the liquid-solid interface, the natural question is whether theoretical methods 
can predict its magnitude and the physical processes that affect it. 
theoretical methods can predict its magnitude and the physical processes that affect it. 

In order to determine $gamma$, it is useful to discuss the energetic and entropic components that make it up, 
since, as we shall see, the different models that have been developed differ markedly in the relative contributions they attribute to these two components. 
The surface Gibbs free energy can be written as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Gibbs_free_energy}
\gamma = E^{(s)} - T S^{(s)} + P V^{(s)}
\end{equation}
In this context, $E^{(s)}$ represents the energy excess at the surface, $S^{(s)}$ denotes the entropy at the surface, and $V^{(s)}$ is the additional volume. 
The latter term remains negligible unless under conditions of high pressure, and can be completely negated by appropriately selecting the Gibbs dividing surface such 
that $V^{(s)}$ becomes zero. This results in only energetic and entropic elements contributing to $\gamma$.

An early and widely adopted model for assessing the free energy at the liquid-solid interface was introduced by \cite{Skapski1956ATO}. This model 
presupposes complete wetting of the crystal by the liquid, leading to a contact angle $\theta$ of zero in the equilibrium involving three phases: 
crystal, liquid, and vapor. Following from Eq.~\ref{eq:Gibbs_free_energy}, with $\theta$ set to zero and consequently $\cos \theta$ equal to one, the derived expression is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Skapski_model}
\gamma_{sl} = \gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{lv}
\end{equation}

Assuming the general case holds, the analysis simplifies to evaluating $\gamma_{sv}$ and $\gamma_{lv}$ independently. This method involves deducing the 
energy difference due to bond disruption between the solid-vapor and liquid-vapor phases, incorporating the solid's fusion enthalpy and melting-induced volume 
change, alongside a modest entropic variation from the external layers of both phases. Consequently, the derived formula is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Skapski_result}
\gamma_{sl} = \frac{\Delta H}{4f N_{A} v^{2/3}} + \frac{2\Delta V}{3V_{s}} \gamma_{lv} + \frac{T_m (\Delta S_l - \Delta S_s)}{f N_{A} v^{2/3}}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a factor that relates the area $A$ of a mole of surface atoms to the volume of a mole of atoms in the bulk solid through
\begin{equation} \label{eq:relation_factor}
A = f N_{A} v^{2/3}
\end{equation}
Numerically, the factor stands at 1.12 for the bcc (110) surface and 1.09 for the fcc (111) surface. Given the 
minimal entropic contribution in Eq.~\ref{eq:Skapski_model}, this framework primarily emphasizes energy aspects. 
Predominantly, the initial term, hinting at a direct relationship between $\gamma_{sl}$ and $\Delta H/v^{2/3}$, 
aligns with empirical findings from initial nucleation studies, underpinning classical homogeneous nucleation theory.

In \cite{Zadumkin1966SurfaceEA} introduced an energy-centric model for surface free energy, emphasizing electron-ion interactions and 
significant volume changes upon melting. Conversely, Turnbull proposed an entropy-focused model, envisioning the solid as a plane 
intersecting the liquid, effectively halving the surface density compared to the bulk liquid. This model assumes negligible energy 
alteration when replacing absent atoms, albeit with reduced configurational entropy due to their fixed positions, tying this adjustment directly to the fusion entropy.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Turnbull_model}
\gamma_{sl} = \frac{T_m \Delta S}{2f N_{A} v^{2/3}} - \frac{\Delta H}{2f N_{A} v^{2/3}}
\end{equation}

Recent approaches have applied physical or computational simulations, notably using hard sphere packings, to gauge surface free energy, 
as detailed by \cite{Spaepen1975ASM}. In these models, spheres form a densely packed crystalline structure, excluding octahedral voids 
to mirror the dense liquid's random packing. Preference is given to tetrahedral gaps, aiming to enhance interfacial layer density. After 
assessing the configurational entropy across different surface arrangements, findings indicated no significant density reduction at the 
interface compared to the dense, random liquid structure. This suggests a minimal energetic impact if hard spheres mimic atoms with attractive forces, 
thus classifying the model as predominantly entropic and forecasting minor energy contributions to $\gamma_{sl}$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Spaepen_model}
\gamma = \frac{\alpha_m \Delta S}{N_{av} v^{2/3}} T
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_m$ is 0.86 for the fcc (111) or hcp (0001) surfaces, and 0.71 for the bcc (110) surface. At $T = T_m$, this has the same form as 
the empirical equation with $\gamma$ proportional to $\Delta H/v^{2/3}$.

Up to now we discussed almost exclusively the case of one-component substances. There is considerable interest, 
especially for metallurgical applications, in the nucleation of binary mixtures or alloys. Calculations in this case 
require a knowledge not only of the bulk thermodynamics of the mixtures (both liquid and solid), but also information about the liquid--solid surface free energy.

Thompson and Spaepen\textsuperscript{42} have extended the theory of \cite{Spaepen1975ASM} to binary alloys. They use Eq.~\ref{eq:Spaepen_model}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Thompson_Spaepen_model}
\gamma = \frac{\alpha_m \Delta S}{N_{A} v^{2/3}} T
\end{equation}
and take $v$ to change linearly with mole fraction between its values for the two pure components. In the same way they take
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Delta_S}
\Delta S = x_A \Delta S_A + (1 - x_A) \Delta S_B
\end{equation}
where $x_A$ is the mole fraction of A in the solid and $\Delta S_A$ and $\Delta S_B$ are the entropies of fusion of the two separate components.

\section{CENTRIFUGAL TECHNOLOGY SELECTION} \label{sec:eng}% ··························································
With the aim to review the available commercial centrifuges, the current section analyses its application for the purification loop of the RC. \\

\noindent The baseline for the given technologies in sections \ref{sec:sss} and \ref{sec:mss} is taken from the SoA report \cite{SoA}, where centrifuge devices for liquid-liquid and liquid-solid separators has been analyzed. 

\subsection{Single Step Separation Approach}\label{sec:sss}
The aim of this study is to provide the centrifuge technology/ies for FLF primary loop with the purpose to extract the solid impurities in the system. The captured requirements for the impurity loop of FLF has been identified as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Continuous solid impurity extraction.
	\item Material compatibility.
	\item Energy efficiency.
	\item Efficiency for given particle size. 
	\item Operating temperature.
	\item Maintenance and cleaning.
	\item Scalability: maximum flow rate.
	\item Scalability: pressure drop.
	\item Concentration of impurities. 
	\item Residence time.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white,colframe=gray!75!black,title=Disclaimer]
	The requirements outlined herein pertain specifically to centrifuge technologies and serve as the foundational basis for the current project. Please note that these requirements are not exhaustive and may be subject to expansion or modification as the project progresses through subsequent stages. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent The technologies can be compared based in the criteria given by the requirements, in order to capture which device or set of devices meet successfully the limited framework. Figure \ref{rad_chart} shows a radar chart with the aim to provide a benchmark based on 8 criteria aligned with the solid separator baseline.

\end{figure}

\noindent Figure \ref{rad_chart} shows the performance of 4 centrifugal technologies, with a direct comparison for 8 scores (table \ref{rad_values} has the values used for the comparison, that has been normalized, and inverted for Energy Cost, Particle Size, Imp. Concentration). Hydrocyclone and Disk Stack Separator are the technologies with better performance in the evaluated fields, better single definition can be found in figure \ref{rad_chart_comp}, where:

 \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,enhanced,breakable,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Hydrocyclone]
 	
 	\textbf{\textit{Advantages:}}
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Material compatibility: The hydrocyclone can be constructed using stainless steel, with SS16 being a commercially available option. Additionally, it can be fabricated from Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP), offering notable advantages in aggressive environments such as those found in chemical and nuclear applications with activating products. This versatility in material selection ensures adaptability to varying operational requirements and environmental conditions, enhancing the hydrocyclone's reliability and longevity in demanding settings.
 		\item Maintenance: Characterized by its absence of rotatory components, comprising four conical segments interconnected via flange bolted connections. This design feature ensures facilitated access to the internal cavity, enabling procedures for cleaning, replacement, or repair purposes.
 		\item Energy cost: The inherent design features, including a tangent inlet inducing a vortex through the cone, eliminates the necessity for moving parts, thus precluding the need for an engine. This architectural advantage translates into significant energy savings, as the hydrocyclone operates without any associated energy costs. Moreover, rigorous examination of inlet velocity's impact underscores the meticulous engineering approach applied to optimize performance.
 		\item Flow rate: It demonstrates superior flow rate management in comparison to the other three analyzed technologies. Moreover, it is commercially available to operate within a manifold architecture, allowing for efficient handling of large volumes. Consequently, it emerges as a prime candidate for processing the primary loop lithium in a single operation.
 	\end{itemize}
 	
 	\textbf{\textit{Disadvantages:}}
 	
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Particle size: Commercially available up to a particle size of 12 $\mu m$, with an impressive efficiency rate of 98\%, while maintaining scalability with a compromise on pressure drop (10-200 KPa). This equilibrium represents the optimal trade-off. Consequently, particles below 12 $\mu m$ can be captured by the hydrocyclone; however, ensuring consistent efficiency for particles of this size is not assured. Therefore, additional stages specifically designed for particles of this size range must be incorporated into the purification system to ensure thorough filtration and purification.
 		\item Impurity concentration: The technology's optimal operational range encompasses concentrations of impurities in the medium exceeding 10\%. Therefore, it is recommended to position this technology as the initial stage within the purification system. This strategic placement ensures efficient removal of contaminants at higher concentrations, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the purification process. Future stages may address more accurate the impurity concentration in the system.
 	\end{itemize}
 	
 	\textbf{\textit{Assessment:}} The hydrocyclone offers exceptional material compatibility, maintenance-friendly design (without of rotatory components), with negligible energy costs and superior flow rate management, based on manifold architectures: the hydrocyclone emerges as an ideal candidate for processing the primary loop fluid. Despite limitations in capturing particles below 12 $\mu m$ and optimal operation at impurity concentrations exceeding 10\%, strategic integration within purification systems enhances overall effectiveness.
 	
 \end{tcolorbox}
 \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,enhanced,breakable,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Disck Stack Separator]
		\textbf{\textit{Advantages:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Particle size: One of the most notable strengths of this technology lies in its ability to effectively capture particles as small as 1 $\mu m$, facilitated by its high centrifugal force and innovative ribs cavity design, which accelerates solid precipitation. Particularly advantageous in scenarios where prior classification or clearance of larger particle sizes has been performed, allowing for optimal exploitation of its particle-capturing capabilities.
		\item Impurity concentration: The operational range for these devices remains optimal when impurity concentrations are below 10\%, presenting an advantageous characteristic when integrated into multi-stage system operations.
		\item Centrifugal force: As a high-speed separator capable of achieving up to 14,000 G, the disk stack separator offers a distinct advantage due to its efficient operation at relatively low energy costs, contrasting with decanter centrifuges. While centrifuge contractor may require similar energy inputs, they do not attain comparable levels of centrifugal force, highlighting the disk stack separator's pivotal role in separation processes based on its design principles.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{\textit{Disadvantages:}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Energy cost: Exhibits relatively higher energy consumption compared to alternative solutions. This aspect should be considered in the evaluation of operational costs and efficiency metrics within the full-scale context.
		\item Maintenance: The trade-off associated with attaining high-speed rotation velocities may influence the maintenance of components, wherein direct access to elements is not a direct action, requiring mechanical assembly-disassembly processes that are less straightforward compared to hydrocyclones.
		\item Flow rate: The limited maximum flow rate capacity of such devices makes them unsuitable for fully processing all the lithium within the primary loop. Furthermore, the absence of commercially available manifolds presents a challenge. Therefore, a rigorous study could be needed to strategically place these devices within the system, coupled with the feasibility assessment for developing a manifold configuration to optimize operational efficiency.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{\textit{Assessment:}} The Disk Stack Separator offers good particle capture capabilities, particularly for particles as small as 1 $\mu m$, making it ideal for scenarios requiring precise filtration after prior particle classification. However, its higher energy consumption and maintenance complexities warrant careful consideration. When compared with hydrocyclones, which excel in energy efficiency and maintenance simplicity, they form complementary components in a comprehensive purification system, each tailored to specific operational requirements and constraints. Integrating both technologies strategically within a multi-stage system can optimize overall efficiency and performance, complementing their disadvantages.

	Decanter centrifuges demonstrate comparable performance to hydrocyclones in particle size handling, centrifugal force generation, and impurity concentration control. However, hydrocyclones offer superior energy efficiency, enhanced material compatibility, and lower maintenance requirements, presenting clear advantages. Notably, hydrocyclones excel in maximizing the maximum flow rate, making them a preferred choice in scenarios prioritizing throughput efficiency and operational cost-effectiveness.

 \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Centrifuge Contactor]
	While centrifuge contactors offer the advantage of producing four-phase liquid separation, they do not present a significant advantage in the fields compared to hydrocyclones. The technology lacks suitability in efficiently handling impurities at required flow rates with the precision demonstrated by alternative technologies, diminishing its practical utility in for the primary loop.

\subsection{Multi-Step Separation Approach}\label{sec:mss}
In the context of a multi-stage separation process, the integration of hydrocyclones and Disk Stack Separators offers a comprehensive solution for fluid purification. The hydrocyclone, as particle cut-off controlled by operation parameters, is particularly adept at classifying and separating coarser particles ($>$ 12 $\mu m$), thereby facilitating the initial removal of larger impurities. Its attributes, including superior material compatibility and a maintenance-friendly design, make it a suitable choice for efficiently processing substantial fluid volumes, thanks to its ability to handle high flow rates and adapt to various manifold configurations.\\


\noindent However, the hydrocyclone's inherent limitations, such as its inability to capture particles below 12 $\mu m$ and its optimal operation in scenarios with impurity concentrations above 10\%, necessitate additional stages for thorough purification. This is where the Disk Stack Separator comes into play, especially in scenarios where specific targets, such as low impurities or activated products separated by density differences like Li-H, need to be addressed. Renowned for its exceptional particle capture efficacy, particularly for particles as small as 1 $\mu m$, the Disk Stack Separator strategically placed downstream of the hydrocyclone enhances the purification process by effectively removing finer particles and residual impurities at low concentrations (up to 0.05\%), thereby ensuring the level of lithium purity.\\


\noindent Despite its advantages, the Disk Stack Separator incurs relatively higher energy consumption and maintenance complexities compared to the hydrocyclone. Therefore, meticulous attention is needed in optimizing the integration of these technologies to ensure overall efficiency. For example, incorporating the Disk Stack Separator as a secondary stage in the purification process allows for precise filtration after larger particles have been removed by the hydrocyclone, as shown in Figure \ref{multi_stage}. At the same time, it raises the requirement to project a future device that captures the high efficiency for small particles at the energy cost and lithium volumes of the hydrcyclone.

\noindent In this multi-stage paradigm, the symbiotic relationship between the hydrocyclone and Disk Stack Separator maximizes each technology's strengths while mitigating respective weaknesses. \\

This technical data serves as the foundational benchmark for subsequent stages of the project, guiding the development of solutions aligned with the current multi-stage framework. The analysis of this data informs decisions regarding the integration of technologies, aiming to optimize the process schema and ultimately enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness.
