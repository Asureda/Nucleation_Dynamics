Cyclone separators are widely used in the field of chemical, mine and petroleum industries. ref.\cite{Concha2007} With the advantages of relative simplicity to fabricate, low cost to operate and good adaptability to extremely harsh conditions, cyclone separators have become one of the most important particle removal devices which are preferably utilized in both environmental and chemical engineering.
In order to describe the performance of cyclone separators, many (gas or liquid)-particle separation theories were developed using different methods with different simplifications and assumptions.
All these can be roughly divided into the pure theory, the semi-empirical theory and the numerical simulation. The former two include the equilibrium-orbit model, time-of-flight model and hybrid model, etc., the later mainly refers to the computation fluid dynamics (CFD) approach ref.\cite{Altmeyer2003}.

In detail, the equilibrium-orbit model, as an early methodology of particle separation, determines the particle size for which centrifugal force is exactly balanced by the drag force. Correspondingly, the collection efficiency for the critically sized particle is often assumed to be 50\% efficiency called cut particle diameter $d_{c,p}$ ref.\cite{Zhao2011}.

 In this section, the necessary parameters and assumptions are defined to correctly define the equilibrium orbit model and obtain an expression for the cyclone separation efficiency.
 \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!black,title=Assumptions]
The following assumption have been made in order to develop the equilibrium-orbit model ref. \cite{Wei2016}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The particle is spherical in shape, the motion of the single particle is not influenced by the presence of neigh-boring particle.
	\item The tangential velocity of the particle is same as the disperse phase stream; and with the particle is the right dispersed phase, the radial velocity direction fo the particle always point to inner vortex.
	\item  The particle move into the inner vortex is the only way to be separated.  
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Fluid model}
%For this problem there are 2 types of phenomena present to describe the flow pattern. The first zone is called the forced vortex, which occurs between r=0 and r=b/2 approximately where the tangential velocity is linear with the angular velocity w (v=w r). On the other hand, we have a free vortex given by the equation:

Swirling flow, or vortex flow, occurs in different types of equipment, such as cyclones, hydrocyclones, spray dryers and vortex burners. Two types of ideal swirling flows are ref.\cite{Marthinussen2011}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Forced vortex flow: swirling flow with the same tangential velocity distribution as a rotating solid body.
	\begin{equation}
		v_{\theta,f}=\omega r 
	\end{equation}
	\item Free vortex flow: the way a frictionless fluid would swirl. The tangential velocity in such a swirl is such that the moment-of-momentum of fluid elements is the same at all radius. 
	\begin{equation} \label{free_vortex_flow}
		v_{\theta,f}(r)=\frac{\kappa}{r^n} \text{  where } 0.4<n<0.9 
	\end{equation}	
	where $\kappa$ is a geometrical parameter and $n$ is a experimental value taken 0.88 as in ref.\cite{Sabbagh2014} 
\end{itemize} 
Figure (\ref{tangential_velocity}) show the schema of the real tangential velocity distribution and the comparison with the forced and free vortex flow.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Motion of suspended particles}
In a hydrocyclone, the particles of interest are almost always moving relative to the liquid at their terminal velocity, and the terminal velocity of a given particle determines whether the particle will be captured or lost.

Applying Newtonâ€™s law to a particle moving in a fluid, equating its mass times acceleration to the sum of the forces acting on it, gives :
\begin{equation}
	m \frac{d v}{d t}= F_{body} + F_{drag} + F_{unsteady}
\end{equation}
where the body force is normally due to a centrifugal force and the fluid drag represents the drag acting on a
particle that moves with a steady velocity relative to the fluid ref.\cite{Sabbagh2014} .
According to several authors ref.\cite{Concha2007,Marthinussen2011}, it turns out that these unsteady terms can be ignored both for the case of a gas cyclone and a hydrocyclone, as practical plant experience with their design and operation indicates that it is not necessary to include either of the terms.


%\subsubsection*{Centrifugal Force}
The centrifugal force (first term on the right part ) can be expressed as :
\begin{align}
	F_{body}=F_{centrifugal}=V_p \left( \rho_p-\rho_{f} \right) \textbf{a}
\end{align}
where $V_p$ is the particle volume, $\rho_p$ is the particle density, $\rho_f$ is the fluid density and $\textbf{a}$ is the global effect of the radial and angular particle acceleration. 

In cylindrical coordinate, omitting the axial contribution, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a_r= \frac{d v_{r,p}}{d t}= \frac{d^2 r}{d t^2 }$ particle radial acceleration 
	
	\item $a_c= r \left( \frac{d \theta}{d t}\right)^2= r \left(\frac{v_{\theta,f} (r)}{r} \right)^2 $ particle angular acceleration
	
\end{itemize}
assuming that the radial particle acceleration in the steady state is negligible, the centrifugal force is equal to:
\begin{equation}
	F_{centrifugal}= \frac{1}{6} \pi d_p ^3 \cdot (\rho_p -\rho_f) \cdot \frac{v_{\theta,f} ^2(r)}{r}
\end{equation}

%\subsubsection*{Drag Force}
on the other hand, when the particle Reynolds number is low ($Re_p = \frac{d_p v_{r,p}}{\nu}<<1$), the
equations of motion for the fluid moving around the particle can be solved, and the drag force 
calculated. If there is no slip between fluid and particle surface, the particle velocity is
equal to the velocity of the fluid at the surface, the result is Stokes drag law: 
\begin{equation}
	F_{drag}=3 \pi  \mu d_p v_{r,p}(r) 
\end{equation}
Therefore, in the steady state, the drag force have to be equal that the centrifugal force:

\begin{equation}
	\sum F_p = 0 \Rightarrow F_{centrifugal}= F_{drag}  
\end{equation}
and the radial velocity of the particle can be expressed as a function of the angular velocity of the fluid given by the vortex flow model as
\begin{equation} \label{radial_velocity_particle}
	v_{r,p}(r)= \frac{\Delta \rho d_p ^2   }{18 \mu } \cdot \frac{v_{\theta,f}^2(r)}{r}
\end{equation}


The following subsections define different parameters necessary to calculate the cyclone separation efficiency.


\subsection{Cyclone effective volume}
To avoid the non-uniform effect on particle collection distance caused by difference between cylindrical and conical shape, the cylinder-conical geometry is equivalently modified as a right cylinder cyclone according to the principle of conservation of effective volume.
The equivalent cyclone volume ($V_{cs}$) and  radius ($R$) can be calculated by: ref.\cite{Zhao2011}
\begin{equation}
	V_{cs}=
	\begin{cases}
		 \frac{\pi D^2 h}{4} +\frac{\pi D^2 }{4} \cdot \frac{S+l-h}{3} \cdot \left[ 1+ \frac{D_c}{D}+ \left(\frac{D_c}{D} \right)^2  \right] ,& \text{if } l\leq (H-S)\\
		\frac{\pi D^2 h}{4} +\frac{\pi D^2 }{4} \cdot \frac{H-h}{3} \cdot \left[ 1+ \frac{B}{D}+ \left(\frac{B}{D} \right)^2  \right],& \text{if } l> (H-S)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{effective_radious_equation}
	{R^*} _w= 
	\begin{cases}
		\left[ \frac{V_{cs}}{\pi (S+l)}\right]^{1/2} ,& \text{if } l\leq (H-S)\\
		\left[ \frac{V_{cs}}{\pi H}\right]^{1/2},& \text{if } l> (H-S)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $D_c= D - \frac{(D-B)(S+l-h)}{H-h}$ and $l$ is called as the natural vortex length of cyclone separator. It is defined as the vertical distance from the bottom of the vortex finder to the end of the vortex at which the outer vortex is reversed or turned into the inner vortex. $l$ is actually the effective vortex length in cyclone separator if it is less than the dimension $Hâ€“S$. Otherwise, $Hâ€“S$ should be the effective vortex length because it depends on the geometrical dimensions of cyclone.
The most famous and widely used relation for estimating the natural vortex length is the Alexanderâ€™ formula ref.\cite{Zhao2011}: 
\begin{equation}
	l=2.3 \left( \frac{D^2}{a b}\right)^{1/3}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Residence time model} 
The residence time $t_{res}$ is the average time  that a particle is inside the cyclone. The expression to calculate $t_{res}$ depend of the geometry of the cyclone and the inlet volumetric flow rate, so according to the geometry selected (Figure \ref{cyclone_schema}) the residence time can be calculates as ref.\cite{Zhao2011}:
\begin{equation}\label{residence_time_equation}
	t_{res}= 
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{\pi \left( R^2 - R_e ^ 2\right) }{Q/2} \cdot l,& \text{if } l\leq (H-S)\\
		\frac{\pi \left( R^2 - R_e ^ 2\right)}{Q/2} \cdot (H-S),& \text{if } l> (H-S)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Separation efficiency model}
In order to calculate the separation efficiency of the cyclone, a balance of mass was made in the volume of control presented in the Figure (\ref{volume_control}) ref.\cite{Zhao2011,Wei2016}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/control_volume.png}
	\captionsetup{font=bf, size=small}
	\caption{volume of control used in the separation efficiency model. ref.\cite{Zhao2011}}
	\label{volume_control}
\end{figure}
In this control volume, it is assumed that uncollected particles in any plane perpendicular to the cyclone axis presents a status of complete radial back-mixing, the boundary layer near the equivalent wall is neglected and particles which move to the equivalent wall will be trapped. If the particle concentration in the control volume is
$c$, then the particle flux toward the equivalent wall is $c v_{r,p}({{R^*}} _w)$ . Therefore, over a height $dz$ the sedimentation rate of particles at the equivalent wall is $ 2 \pi {{R^*}} _w c v_{r,p}({R^*} _w) $ . Correspondingly, the rate of particles separated from the control volume is $c \pi {{R^*}} _w^2 dz$.
According to particle mass balance, we have:


\begin{align}
	\frac{d M}{d t }=& \sum M_{in} -\sum M_{out}\\
	\frac{d(c \pi {R^*} _w^2 dz)}{dt}=& -\sum M_{out}= - c v_{r,p}({R^*} _w) 2 \pi {R^*} _w dz\\
	\frac{d c}{d t}=& - \frac{2v_{r,p}(R* _w)}{{R^*} _w} \cdot c \\
	\frac{c(t)}{c_0}=& exp \left(- \frac{2v_{r,p}({R^*} _w) t}{{R^*} _w} \right)
\end{align}

Integrating, with $c(t=0)=c_0$ and $c_{final}=c(t_{res})$ where $t_{res}$ is the particle residence time:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{c_{final}}{c_{0}}= exp \left(- \frac{2v_{r,p}({R^*} _w) t_{res}}{{R^*} _w} \right)
\end{equation}
therefore, the separation efficiency is defined as 
\begin{align} 
	\eta=&1-\frac{c_{final}}{c_{0}}\\
	\eta=&1- exp \left(- \frac{2v_{r,p}({R^*} _w) t_{res}}{{R^*} _w} \right) \label{efficiency_equation}
\end{align}
where $v_{r,p}({R^*} _w)$ is the particle settling velocity at the equivalent wall
and is calculated according to Eq. (\ref{radial_velocity_particle}) 

\section{Results: Parametric analysis}

For the following analysis, the geometric dimensions present in the table \ref{input_information} have been used as a basis. This information was used to see how the separation efficiency of the cyclone varies when the Lithium temperature, the diameter of the cyclone and the inlet flow change.

	\label{input_information}
\end{table}
\subsection{Parametric analysis: Temperature}
Figure (\ref{temperature_cyclone}) shows the efficiency as a function of the particle diameter of Fe for the temperature of the Start-Up, HEX outlet and lower tank calculated in ref. \cite{power_scenario}. 


\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/efficiency_vs_Temperature.png}
	\captionsetup{font=bf, size=small}
	\caption{Separation efficiency as a function of the particle diameter of Fe for different temperatures.}
	\label{temperature_cyclone}
\end{figure}
As the temperature increases, the fluid viscosity decreases, so the drag force  decrease and the particle velocity increase. Also, the difference in density fluid-particle also increases (since the density of lithium decreases with temperature) so that the centrifugal force grow. Those effects allows efficiency to increase with temperature.
\subsection{Parametric analysis: Cyclone diameter}
Figure (\ref{cyclone_diameter})  shows the separation efficiency as a function of the particle diameter of Fe for different cyclone diameters.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/efficiency_vs_cyclone_diameter.png}
	\captionsetup{font=bf, size=small}
	\caption{}
	\label{cyclone_diameter}
\end{figure}
By increasing the diameter and keeping the scaling and flow variables constant, the velocity in the inlet decreases. This decrease causes that the velocity of the particles to drop and the efficiency to drop. On the other hand, as the diameter increases, the residence time increases given by the equation (\ref{residence_time_equation}) and this effect tends to increase efficiency, however, it is not as important as the other effect mentioned before.

%By increasing the diameter,  it is possible to process more flow in each cyclone. However, the separation efficiency decreases. It is a compromise decision since is needed to know the minimum particle diameter that have to be eliminated.
Thus, there is a trade-off in deciding the optimal cyclone diameter, and it will also depend on the minimum particle diameter of the impurities which need to be eliminated.
\subsection{Parametric analysis: volumetric inlet flow rate}
Given one of the limitations of cyclones is the possibility of scaling efficiency to industrial-type flows, in the chemical or mine industry it is very common to use more than 1 cyclone in parallel ref. \cite{Concha2007}. For this reason it is of interest to know how the efficiency changes as we increase the volumetric inlet flow rate of the cyclone.

Figure (\ref{inlet_VRF}) show the separation efficiency as a function of the particle diameter for different volumetric inlet flow rate form from 0.5 to 3.5 $m^3/s$ (similar to pilot plant). 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{images/efficiency_vs_inlet_VFR.png}

		\label{inlet_velocity}
	\end{subfigure}
	\captionsetup{font=bf, size=small}
	\caption{ }
	\label{}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that as volumetric flow rate decrease, the separation efficiency decreases. This is because as the flow rate at the inlet of the cyclone decreases, the velocity in the inlet drop (Figure \ref{inlet_velocity}) and consequently the velocity with which the particle heads towards the walls of the cyclone. It is important to note that industrial-scale cyclones usually operate with an inlet speed between 20-30 m/s, so this limitation should be added in the following sections to have a realist results.

Figure (\ref{inlet_VRF_porcent}) show the separation efficiency as a function of the particle diameter when VFR change +/- 20 \% using 3 $m^3/s$ as a $VFR_{base}$. Figure (\ref{inlet_VRF_relative}) display the relative separation efficiency  $ \left( \frac{ \eta(VFR)-\eta(VFR_{base})}{\eta(VFR_{base})} \right)$ as a function of the particle diameter.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\captionsetup{font=bf, size=small}
	\caption{ }
	\label{inlet_VRF_relative}
\end{figure}

Figure (\ref{inlet_VRF_relative}) shows  that the efficiency increases proportionally to the increase in VRF when the particle diameter is low. As the diameter of the particle increases, the effect of increasing VRF begins to decrease. However, it must be taken into account that the pressure loss varies with the square of the velocity in the inlet $\left(
\Delta p \propto v_{inlet} ^2 \right)$, so if the flow rate changes 10\% the pressure loss would increase by approximately 21\%.

\subsection{Optimization methodology}
In the previous section, the dimensions of a cyclone present in ref.\cite{Zhao2011} were used. That cyclone was used as a reference to see how the efficiency change for some parameters of interest such as temperature or flow rate, but said geometry was not optimal for the problem to be solved. For this reason, in this section the optimization process of the cyclone geometry is presented to maximize the separation efficiency, using both the fluid and the particle materials of interest for the problem.
\subsubsection{Geometrical optimization}

The next section presents how the optimization process was developed. For this, the Python library \texttt{Optimize} is used and \texttt{SLSQP} (Sequential Least Squares Programming) is used as the optimization method. In order to use this method, it is necessary to define the function to be minimized, the variables and both geometric and performance limitations.

In order to define the function, if a  target efficiency $\eta_{target}$ is defined , according to equation (\ref{efficiency_equation}) the radial velocity of the particle is

\begin{equation}
	v_{r,p}= - \frac{ln(1-\eta_{target})}{2 t_{res}} \cdot {R^*} _w
\end{equation}
On the other hand, using the equation (\ref{free_vortex_flow}), (\ref{effective_radious_equation}) and  (\ref{residence_time_equation})  the diameter of the particle can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
	d_p ^2 =&   \frac{18 \mu	v_{r,p}({R^*} _w) {R^*} _w}{\Delta \rho v_{\theta,f} ^2 ({R^*} _w)} \\
	d_p ^2 =&  - \frac{ln(1-\eta_{target})}{2 t_{res}} \cdot \frac{18 \mu {R^*} _w^2}{\Delta \rho v_{\theta,f}^2({R^*} _w) }\\
	d_p ^2 =&  - \frac{ln(1-\eta_{target})}{2 t_{res}} \cdot \frac{18 \mu {R^*} _w^{(2+2n)}}{\kappa^2 }
\end{align}
where the diameter of the particle is defined as a function of the target efficiency, inlet velocity (present in the parameter $\kappa$) and geometry (present in $t_{res}$, ${R^*}_w$ and $\kappa$). With this information, was used as a function to minimize,  the cut diameter defined as  the particle diameter for which the capture efficiency is equal to 50 \% $d_{p,c}=d_p(\eta=50 \%)$:
\begin{equation}
	d_{p.c} (\vec{x})  =  \left(  -  \frac{ln(0.5)}{2 t_{res}} \cdot \frac{18 \mu {R^*} _w^{(2+2n)}}{\kappa^2 }  \right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{x}=(D,D_e,H,B,h,S,a,b)$ is the vector with all of geometrical variables of the cyclone.

In order to close the problem, the constrains used were:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $h>S$
	\item $h>a$
	\item $D>D_e+b$
	\item $D_e>b$
	\item $H>S$
	\item $H>h$
	\item $D_e>B$
	\item $10$\textdegree $<\alpha<20$\textdegree , where $\alpha= arctan \left(  \frac{D-B}{2(H-h)} \right) $
	\item $v_{inlet} < v_{max}$
\end{enumerate}

Given that the problem has 8 variables  there are only inequalities as a constrains, more than one local minimum may exist within the domain. For this reason, the optimizer was  initialized with  different seeds in order to obtain the different local minima present in the domain.Then, a family of cyclones was obtained that meet the conditions within the domain, where the cutting diameter varies by less than 10\% and the geometric dimensions change.

%La figura () muestra el valor del diametro de corte en funcion del diametro optimo encontrado usando 256 semillas. se puede observar que a medida que aumenta la cantidad de cyclones en paralelo, el diametro del cyclone disminuye y disminuye considerablemente el diametro de corte. En el caso de utilizar solo un cyclone el diametro necesariamente tiene que ser muy grande para que la velocidad en el inlet no sea demasiado alta.

For the optimization process, a parametric analysis was carried out where the VFR was varied in the inlet of the cyclone in order to have the same operating conditions in the cyclone for both the commercial and pilot plants and, consequently, the highest separation efficiency with the minimum loss of energy. The ratio between the VFR of the commercial plant and the pilot plant is approximately 9 $\left( \frac{(VFR_{total})_{commercial}}{(VFR_{total})_{pilot}} \approx 9 \right )$ so if you want to have the same efficiency for both plants, it is necessary to increase the number of cyclones 9 times when scaling the plant from the pilot to the commercial one.

%On the other hand, another possible alternative if the maximum number of cyclones for the commercial plant is limited, either due to economic cost or space limitations, etc., figure () shows the sensitivity of the efficiency when varying the VFR inlet in the cyclone. 

Figure (\ref{Fe_d_cut_off}) ,(\ref{Cr_d_cut_off}) and (\ref{AlN_d_cut_off}) shows the cut off diameter ($\eta=50\%$)  for the Fe, Cr and AlN, respectively.  For this analysis, it has been used that the maximum velocity in the inlet has to be less than 25 m/s.

It can be seen that the cutting diameter of both Fe and Cr are quite similar and smaller than that of AlN. This is because the density of Fe is similar to that of Cr, while the density of AlN is much lower. This causes the radial velocity of the particle towards the walls to be lower and the efficiency tends to decrease, so the diameter of the particle must be larger to be captured.

Since the inlet maximum velocity was limited in the optimization process, when the volumetric flow rate increase the cyclone diameter and the inlet dimensions have to grow to have enough space to allocate the inlet and reduce the velocity.    

Table (\ref{info_cyclone}) presents the dimensions of 5 cyclones that can operate at different VFRs. In addition, the cutting diameter for Fe, Cr and AlN is presented and an estimate of the number of cyclones that could be used either in the commercial plant or in the pilot plant.

It can be seen that as the volumetric flow rate at the inlet increases, the cut off diameter decrease for all the particles analyzed, causing the lose of separation efficiency. On the other hand, in order to  choose the correct cyclone,the total pressure loss of the system have to be considered. In the literature there are a large number of correlations to calculate pressure loss \cite{Concha2007,Altmeyer2003}, however these are developed mainly for gas-solid cyclones and not for liquid-solid as in this case. For this reason, in the CFD section, importance will be given to the calculation of said parameter.
