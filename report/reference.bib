@report{Clouet1,
   abstract = {Nucleation is the onset of a first-order phase transition by which a metastable phase transforms into a more stable one. Such a phase transition occurs when an initial system initially in equilibrium is destabilized by the change of an external parameter like the temperature or the pressure. If the perturbation is small enough, the system does not become unstable but rather stays metastable. In diffusive transformations, the system then evolves through the nucleation, the growth and the coarsening of a second phase. Such a phase transformation is found in a lot of situations in materials science like condensation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated vapor, solidification, precipitation from a supersaturated solid solution, … The initial stage of all these different processes can be well described within the same framework currently know as the classical nucleation theory. Since its initial formulation in 1927 by Volmer, Weber and Farkas [1, 2] and its modification in 1935 by Becker and Döring [3] the classical nucleation theory has been a suitable tool to model the nucleation stage in phase transformations. The success of this theory relies on its simplicity and on the few parameters required to predict the nucleation rate, i.e. the number of clusters of the new phase appearing per unit of time and of volume. It allows rationalizing experimental measurements, predicting the consequences of a change of the control parameters like the temperature or the supersaturation, and describing nucleation stage in mesoscopic modeling of phase transformations. In this article, we first describe the results obtained by Volmer, Weber, Farkas, Becker and Döring [1, 2, 3] and which constitutes the classical nucleation theory. These results are the predictions of the precipitate size distribution, of the steady-state nucleation rate and of the incubation time. This theory describes the nucleating system as a homogeneous phase where heterophase fluctuations occur. Some of these fluctuations reach a size big enough so that they can continue to grow and lead to the formation of precipitates. The nucleating system is thus envisioned mainly from a thermodynamic viewpoint. The key controlling parameters are the nucleation driving force and the interface free energy. A kinetic approach, the cluster dynamics, can also be used to describe nucleation. This constitutes the second part of this article. Here, a master equation describes the time evolution of the system which is modeled as a cluster gas. The key parameters are the cluster condensation and evaporation rates. Both approaches are different in their description of the nucleating system and in their needed input parameters. They are nevertheless closely related. Predictions of the classical nucleation theory have been actually derived from the same master equation used by cluster dynamics [3], and extensions of classical nucleation theory always starts from this master equation. In this article the links as well as the difference between both descriptions are emphasized. Since its initial formulation, the classical nucleation theory has been enriched, mainly by Binder and Stauffer [4, 5, 6], so as to take into account the fact that clusters other than monomers can migrate and react. It has been also extended to multi-component systems [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. These generalizations of the initial formalism are presented at the end of the second part. Thermodynamic Approach Conditions for Nucleation Nucleation occurs when a homogeneous phase initially in stable thermal equilibrium is put in a state where it becomes metastable by the variation of a controlling parameter. In the following case, the controlling parameter is the temperature and the initial system is quenched through a first-order phase transition in a two-phase region. The system then tends to evolve toward a more stable state and to reach its equilibrium. As the parent phase is not unstable, this transformation cannot proceed through the continuous development of growing infinitesimal perturbations delocalized in the whole},

While the advanced molecular approaches based on the density functional theory provide detailed microscopic information on nucleation in simple model systems, they appear to have limited relevance to such complex systems as the oxide glasses. In contrast, a semiempirical Cahn-Hilliard model and a phenomenological diffuse interface theory were found to reproduce the proper magnitude and sign of the temperature coefficient for the crystal-liquid interfacial free energy emerging from nucleation experiments on stoichiometric glasses.

Systematic deviations are observed in the thermal activation of the measured and predicted induction times that lead to a crossover near the glass transition. Below crossover, the viscosity based induction times are higher than the experimental ones, a relation that is reversed at higher temperatures. The differences, that may amount to orders of magnitude far from the crossover temperature, cannot be removed by taking into account the size dependence of the interfacial free energy, the depletion of the monomers, or by enforcing the proper (zero) value of the free energy of monomers.

The effect of subcritical cluster population (influenced by the curvature dependence of the interfacial free energy and the self-consistency criterion) on the formation rate and number of observable clusters (that exceed a fixed supercritical size) is investigated. It has been found that both effects have a perceptible influence on transformation kinetics. A quantitative test of the Turnbull-Fisher model has been performed by comparing the experimental growth rates with those calculated with a diffusion coefficient evaluated from the measured nucleation rate and induction time data. For three compositions of the six investigated, significant differences have been observed between theory and experiment, that could not be removed by introducing a curvature dependent interfacial free energy or by enforcing the proper monomer limit of the cluster free energy.

@book_section{Myerson2019,
   abstract = {Crystallization from solutions is a complex process completed in several stages. The first stage is the formation of supersaturated solution because the spontaneous appearance of a new phase can occur only when a system is in a nonequilibrium condition. In the next stage, molecules dissolved in solution begin to aggregate to relieve the supersaturation and move the system toward equilibrium. The molecular aggregation process eventually leads to the formation of nuclei that can act as centers of crystallization. A nucleus can be defined as the minimum amount of a new phase capable of independent existence (Khamskii 1969). The nature of nuclei (i.e., whether they are amorphous particles or tiny crystals) is still unknown. The birth of these small nuclei in an initially metastable phase is called nucleation, which is a major mechanism of first-order phase transition. Kashchiev and van Rosmalen (2003) describe nucleation as the process of fluctuational appearance of nanoscopically small clusters of the new crystalline phase, which can grow spontaneously to macroscopic sizes. The growth stage, which immediately follows nucleation, is governed by the diffusion of particles, called growth units, to the surface of the existing nuclei and their incorporation into the structure of the crystal lattice (Khamskii 1969). This stage continues until all the solute in excess of saturation is consumed for the development of mature crystals. The initial stages of crystallization, which can be defined as the period between the achievement of supersaturation and the formation of nuclei, plays a decisive role in determining properties of the resulting solid phase, such as purity, crystal structure, and particle size. Thus higher levels of control over crystallization cannot be achieved without understanding the fundamentals of nucleation.},

   abstract = {The principles of statistical mechanics have been used to develop a theory of the nucleation of a phase transition, but a number of subtle questions remain and are highlighted in this review. A central issue is the cluster definition, the mathematical scheme which distinguishes a molecular cluster from a collection of separate molecules. There is also the question of whether thermodynamic transition state theory is suitable to describe the process, or whether the development of kinetic rate equations describing cluster growth and decay is a better approach. The classical theory of nucleation is flawed but appears to provide useful estimates in some cases, including water. Phenomenological extensions of the classical theory can improve matters. However, improvements in the theory from microscopic considerations are not simple to apply, require major computational effort and suffer from uncertainties due to lack of knowledge of the fundamental intermolecular interactions. Calculations of the nucleation rate of water droplets are especially difficult since this substance is notoriously difficult to model. Nevertheless, as capabilities improve, accurate calculations should come within reach, which will offer better understanding of the process for practical applications such as the transition from dry to wet steam. © IMechE 2004.},

   abstract = {We review a plethora of relevant experimental results on internal homogeneous crystal nucleation in silicate glasses obtained in the last four decades, and their analyses in the framework of the classical nucleation theory (CNT). The basic assumptions and equations of CNT are outlined. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of the properties of the critical nuclei, which, to a large extent, govern nucleation kinetics. The main methods employed to measure nucleation rates are described and the possible errors in the determination of the crystal number density (and, correspondingly, in nucleation rates) are discussed. The basic regularities of both time and temperature dependencies of nucleation rates are illustrated by numerous experimental data. Experimental evidence for a correlation between maximum nucleation rates and reduced glass transition temperatures is presented and theoretically justified. Special attention is given to serious problems that arise in the quantitative description of nucleation rates when using the CNT, for instance: the dramatic discrepancy between calculated and measured nucleation rates; the high value of the crystal nuclei/melt surface energy, σcm, if compared to the expected value estimated via Stefan's rule; the increase of σcm with increasing temperature; and the discrepancies between the values of the surface energy and the time-lag for nucleation when independently estimated from nucleation and growth kinetics. The analysis of the above mentioned problems leads to the following conclusion: in contrast to Gibbs' description of heterogeneous systems underlying CNT, the bulk thermodynamic properties of the critical nuclei generally differ from those of the corresponding macro-phase resulting simultaneously in significant differences of the surface properties as compared with the respective parameters of the planar interfaces. In particular, direct experimental evidence is presented for compositional changes of the crystal nuclei during formation of the critical nuclei and their growth from critical to macro-sizes. In addition, detailed examinations of crystal nucleation and growth kinetics show a decrease of both the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation and of the critical nuclei/liquid interfacial energy, as compared with the respective properties of the macro-phase. However, despite significant progress in understanding crystal nucleation in glasses in the past four decades, many problems still exist and this is likely to remain a highly interesting subject for both fundamental and applied research for a long time. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {For several inorganic glasses predictions have been made of the homogeneous crystal nuclea-tion rate using classical nucleation theory. However, in none of these cases were comparisons made with experiment, due primarily to the inability of being able to guarantee homogeneous conditions. Evidence has been provided that crystallite formation in Li20-2 SiO2 glass may initiate by a homogeneous mechanism. Thus, we have computed the nucleation rate curve of lithium disilicate crystals in this glass. It is found that not only do all forms of the classical theory predict nucleation rates many orders of magnitude smaller than those observed, but also that the temperature dependence of the theoretical rate is quite different from that observed.},

   abstract = {Based on classical nucleation theory, a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation for the time evolution of the cluster size distribution is formulated. The numerical solution of this equation leads to a general scenario of first order phase transitions in systems with molecule conservation proceeding via nucleation and growth. For the initial stage of nearly constant supersaturation, the proportionality of the mean cluster radius, (R), to the square root of time, t, is verified. The following transition to the stage of Ostwald ripening may proceed either by a continuous decrease of the growth rate or via a transient stage of (R)-growth considerable slower than t I/3. The explanation of such different possibilities is given in detail. The analysis shows that, for growth processes proceeding via an attachment of single monomers and non-overlapping diffusion zones of the clusters, only one population of clusters with an unimodal size distribution should evolve. The small-angle-X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment data from the present study show, however, the existence of two cluster populations with significantly different mean radii. Additional physical assumptions are deduced from which an explanation of a bimodal size distribution is proposed. To support this general scenario, a series of experimental results from electron microscopic, SAXS and other measurements are given for the case of silver halide precipitation from glass-forming sodium borate melts. They show the time evolution of characteristic kinetic quantities such as relative supersaturation, mean cluster size and total cluster number.},

   abstract = {The Redlich-Kister (R-K) polynomial has been generally used to model the mixing properties of binary and higher order alloys. The interaction energy parameters of the R-K polynomial are assumed to be either linear or exponentially temperature-dependent. When these parameters are assumed to be linear temperature-dependent, the computed thermodynamic functions sometimes show unusual trends. But when they are assumed to be exponential temperature-dependent, such trends do not appear in the theoretical calculations. Therefore, the mixing properties of Cu-Mg liquid alloy have been studied using the exponential temperature-dependent parameters of the above-mentioned model. These parameters for excess Gibb’s free energy of mixing have been optimised using the experimental values of enthalpy of mixing and excess entropy of mixing. The study of thermodynamic properties involves the measurement of excess Gibb’s free energy of mixing, enthalpy of mixing and activities of monomers at different temperatures. Likewise, the assessment of surface property includes surface tension and surface concentration. Similarly, the structural properties have been studied by computing concentration fluctuation in long wave-length limit and short-range order parameter at different temperatures. The investigation revealed that the exponential model can explain mixing behavior of Cu-Mg liquid alloy and the system is found to have strong compound forming tendency at its melting temperature. This mixing tendency has been observed to decrease with the increase in temperature above its melting temperature.},

After a brief introduction to different growth models, the nature of impurities and types of impurity effects on growth kinetics, adsorption of impurities on F faces at relatively low and high impurity concentrations is first discussed. Here mechanisms of adsorption at kinks in steps and surface terrace in the presence of low concentrations of one impurity and two competitive impurities are presented. Then the concepts of adsorption of impurities involving the formation of two-dimensional impurity layer and three-dimensional impurity clusters as growth promotors on a growing face are developed. Thereafter the mechanism of adsorption of impurities on S and K faces and the determination of the adsorption mechanism on a growing face from the kinetic data are discussed. Finally, impurity effects on surface morphology of bulk crystals, and growth morphodroms of alkali halides are briefly reviewed.}

Using the first principle calculations method, we analyzed the surface terminal structure of AlN and its evolution under different conditions by determining the surface energy, adsorption energy, and evaporation energy of the Al and N terminals on the AlN(0001) surface. Our results show that the reason why the N terminal is less stable than the Al terminal is not only because of its high surface energy but also because its adsorption performance is extremely sensitive to the adsorption position. The surface N atoms combine to form N2 molecules that escape during the evaporation process at high temperature. After surface N atoms escape, the AlN surface structure reconstitutes to form a (Formula presented.) hexagonal closest packing (HCP)–like structure, and the energy barrier for the reconstructing process is 3.2 eV. This shows that the structure and form of the AlN(0001) terminals depend on the environmental conditions.},

The aim of present work was to calculate the surface tension of these alloys based on thermodynamic data and Butler model. The surface tension of silicon based alloys increased with an increase in zirconium concentration while that of the zirconium based alloys decreased with an increase in silicon concentration. Both silicon based and zirconium based alloys were found to have negative coefficients of temperature for surface tension. The calculated surface tension values were in good agreement with published experimental data, which indicated that the calculation model and database were effective for calculating surface tension of silicon based and zirconium based alloys.},
