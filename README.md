# Nucleation Dynamics

## Overview
Nucleation Dynamics is a computational framework designed to simulate and analyze nucleation processes. This interdisciplinary project offers tools and examples for the study of nucleation, catering to researchers and students in physics, chemistry, and materials science. It leverages the Julia and Python programming languages to provide a powerful and flexible environment for numerical simulations.

- **Simulation Framework**: Built on [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and Python, offering flexibility and performance for numerical simulations.
- **Example Cases**: Contains a variety of example simulations demonstrating different aspects of nucleation dynamics.
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend and integrate with other computational tools and libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Julia (version x.x or later)
- Python (version 3.x or later)


This project uses `pyproject.toml` for Python dependency management and will adopt a similar approach for Julia package management.

### Installation

#### Python Environment Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asureda/Nucleation_Dynamics.git
   cd Nucleation_Dynamics
   pip install .
```
